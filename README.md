## Description

[project 1]: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css?ref=lnav

This project, which can be found in [TheOdinProject.com][project 1], has helped me putting in practise some of the techniques I have been learning since I decided to dive into web development. In the some way, the project has allowed me to putting into use some of the tools I have came across online and University/College tutorials.

I have been meaning to do a project from start to finish, by myself, for ages, but I was never courageous enough to do so. I would limit myself to watch tutorials, read arcticles, and write code while following along tutorials but never actually give it a go to something such this one. Guess what! I loved it! What an amazing journey! Having to consult documentation whenever I was stuck not knowing what was causing those lines of code to erros, in HTML and CSS, made me figure out hard way. For the first time I would see myself seriously looking up for solutions in order to achieve the Google page looking. Once was finished, the satisfaction of being able to do what you once have doubts you could do it it's hard to describe.  

Even before starting conding, the process of getting my project ready to get started only enriched me as developer: from setting up the codinge nvironment (by the way, Visual Studio is an amazing text editor with lots of great features that makes developers experiences a lot easier) to create the repo in GitHub and clone it to my local machine with Git, and to create a README.md file and understand why is important to have a good written README.md along the project. 

Last but not least, exploiting chrome Dev tools made me realise how useful that is for debugging and even for quickly applying some styling and see it live. I know we read many times that only by using the "just do it" approach we really learn things but somehow it is actually hard to get out there and do it. But... one more time "just do it!" :smile:
